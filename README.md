# Paper Adjustment for day-to-day variability in mixture models

Humans are exposed to a multitude of substances at the same time, thus, toxicity assessment not only for the individual substances but for mixtures of several substances is critical.
An important challenge in testing the mixture effects of many substances in vitro is the variability between individual experiments, also named `day-to-day variabilityâ€™.
Two steps, each consisting of independent experiments, are needed when mixtures are tested. 
In the first step, for each substance, the concentration-response relationship is measured usually with 6-10 concentration for at least $3$ experiments, and EC$_{20}$ values, i.e. the concentration where a fitted curve intersects with a viability value of 80\%, are determined.
These values are used as reference values and the mixture of several substances is based on the individual EC$_{20}$ values.
Since the mixture experiments are new, independent experiments, typically conducted on different days, day-to-day variability can lead to deviations in the cytotoxicity at the reference EC$_{20}$ concentration, i.e. to higher or lower observed viabilities.
In this work, a procedure is proposed, how a single concentration per substance tested in the same experiment as the mixture can be reliably used to adjust for day-to-day variability.
In the here-established procedure, a specific additive model denoted as `budget approach' is introduced as a reference model to explore potential positive or negative interaction effects between compounds.
